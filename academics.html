In the future he plans on going to college abroad to futher his education in the medical field and posibly computer science. Here's a list of clases he's taken over the 3 years. Also here is a link to his school hompage so you can see why the Northern Knights are the best school around.

      I am intrested in Technology Creation, the Medical Field, and sports. What I love about technology is how you can create anything with hardwork and imagination. I am interested in the Medical field because, it is my dream to become a doctor and work with sports players, maybe also do a little bit of bioenginering. My future goal is to be certified in Nurse Aide (CNA)
in Patient Care Technician (PCT) by 12th grade through the OSTC program. I am also aiming to learn Java script and Python. In addition, another future goal is to get a scholarship for either sports or academics for college.
