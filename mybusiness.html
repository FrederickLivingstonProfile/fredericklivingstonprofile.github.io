        Mission statement to keep people mentally healthy and to help the mentally ill through combining technology and medical processes.

    </h3>
    <p>
      One issue in the community is mental health. Especially with covid good mental health is hard to find. Because of this many people kill themselves or harm people around them. I'm passionate about this because during covid even I was down and knew people who were. So my business idea is to have a mental health app that is for people who are mentally healthy as well as people who aren’t or have specific conditions. For example, for people who are mentally fit we would have everyday brain puzzlers and give new fun facts so that they are constantly learning and using their brain. For someone who has a mental health condition like Autism we would offer cool down games so when they are frustrated and a way for them to communicate when they are having trouble. We would also give them therapists in the area and outlets for them like sports or arcade places so they can go have some fun and keep their mind off stressful situations.

    <h3>
      Why Us?
    </h3>
    <p>
      You should chose us because we will not only help patients through a screen we will also try to open our own therapy office to interact with patients in person so we build a relationship with them to help them and if we aren’t a close accessible location we will share the data we collect with other offices in near the patient so when they go in to the locations we suggest other offices will already have background information so you can accelerate your process.
